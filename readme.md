# ITSOLERA AI Data Science Internship – Task 01

## 📌 Task Objective

The main goal of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and basic data processing on a dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**. The task focused on understanding and manipulating the data, computing key statistics, and preparing it for further analysis.

## 🛠️ My Approach

To complete this task, I followed these steps:

1. **Loaded the dataset** into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Explored the structure** of the dataset using methods like `df.info()` to understand the columns, data types, and missing values.
3. **Cleaned the data**:
   - Removed duplicate records.
   - Ensured correct column names for readability.
4. **Calculated basic statistics** such as mean, median, and standard deviation using NumPy.
5. **Derived new features**, such as adding sepal length and sepal width for additional insight.

## 📊 Results and Insights

- The dataset consists of **150 records** with **4 numeric features** related to iris flower measurements (sepal and petal dimensions). 
- No missing values were observed, and all columns were of type float64 after cleaning.
- After dropping duplicates, the data was used to calculate key statistics:
  - **Mean** of (size_sepal,size_petal) columns
  - **Median** of (size_sepal,size_petal) columns
  - **Standard deviation** of (size_sepal,size_petal) columns
- A new feature **`size_sepal`** was generated by adding sepal length and sepal width to gain a combined measure of sepals.
- A new feature **`size_petal`** was generated by adding petal length and petal width to gain a combined measure of petal.
- These insights help understand the central tendency and variability of the dataset, making it easier to use in further modeling or visualization tasks.

## 📁 Files Included

- `task1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code with analysis, explanations, and results.
